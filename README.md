# The simplest possible Scala / Play Framework WebSocket example

This source code shows the “simplest possible” Play Framework WebSocket
example. The server side of the code is almost as simple as it can be,
except that I use `JsValue` types instead of `String`. Using `String` 
would make it slightly easier, but using `JsValue` and JSON makes it
a more real-world example.

Both the Server and Client code are heavily documented. For a full
description, see my article, [(Almost) The simplest possible Play 
Framework WebSocket example](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/play-framework-websocket-simple-example-hello-world/).

All the best,
